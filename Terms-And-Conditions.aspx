We ship within Bhubaneswar area only.It is your obligation to enter the correct delivery address details at the time of ordering. We are unable to deliver to a P.O. Box. Our fixed minimum purchase mount is INR 200/-.
Delivery or Shipping is chargeable:
To find out the shipping charges that apply to you, simply add the items to your shopping cart and proceed accordingly to the checkout where the full cost will be calculated and displayed before you make any payment.
Delivery or Shipping is not chargeable:
We do not charge for deliveries within Bhubaneswar area if a single transaction would be more than fixed minimum purchase amount.
We use all reasonable efforts to dispatch orders within 3 business hours of the purchase time in a single day. It is your responsibility to inform us promptly if an order does not arrive either by emailing info@btbasket.com or calling 90404 50505. Once we learn an order has not arrived within a reasonable period we will lodge an enquiry and advise you of any issues that are discovered. 
We are not liable for any loss or damage resulting from late delivery or non-delivery and late delivery does not entitle you to cancel your order. Also we are not liable for any loss or damage after items delivered and checked against receipt by receiver.
You have the option to have your item delivered with or without a signature of receipt and checking. If you choose to have the item delivered without a signature of receipt you are responsible for any loss or damage after delivery.
If you choose to sign for your item you will generally need to be available between 10:00am and 8:00pm to receive the delivery.  You have the option to choose a different delivery address than your billing address. 
For example you may want to use your work address for delivery if your employer’s workplace policies allow this. If you do not answer when the courier tries to deliver your order, the courier will generally leave a card. You must then contact the courier directly to arrange re-delivery. Without limitation, we are not liable for any loss or damage as a result of you failing to contact our courier within the time specified in any “article awaiting collection” notice left by the courier at the time of delivery.
